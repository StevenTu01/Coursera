# Survey for Dynamic Neural network
Over the last decade several advances have been made in the paradigm of 
artificial neural networks with specific emphasis on architectures and learning algorithms.
it is envisaged that dynamic neural networks, 
in addition to better representation of biological neural systems,
offer better computational capabilities compared to their static counterparts.
